        <p>hello lovely human!<br>you have found my little corner of the internet, so allow me to introduce myself. my name is <i>oliver jan krylow</i>. in the cyber world i am known as <code>bugabinga</code> which is fantastically meaningless and has a cool phonology.</p>
        <p>it was given to me by my little sister when we were young and i have liked it ever since.</p>
        <p>i am a software engineer living in germany working as a dark matter developer working on desktop applications.</p>
        <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineering">
            <p>software engineering sees its practitioners as individuals who follow well-defined engineering approaches to problem-solving. these approaches are specified in various software engineering books and research papers, always with the connotations of predictability, precision, mitigated risk and professionalism.</p>

            <p>my coworker damian edwards and i hypothesize that there is another kind of developer than the ones we meet all the time. we call them dark matter developers. they don't read a lot of blogs, they never write blogs, they don't go to user groups, they don't tweet or facebook, and you don't often see them at large conferences. where are these dark matter developers online?</p>

        <p>despite that i am very active in the free and open source world. i am obsessed with learning, especially about technology. which is why i am unbeliveably happy to live in times when internet access is cheap and a lot of human knowledge as well.</p>

        <p>foss (free and open software) is the modern day result of the free software movement that draws its philosophies from the 1970s hacker culture of the love of programming and excellence. it hasn’t changed much since then. read the article to know more about foss.</p>
